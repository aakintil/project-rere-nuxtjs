            Our mission is to proffer a sustainable waste
            management practices by providing door to door waste
            disposal services while making available sufficient
            supply and top quality recyclable materials for
            reprocessing into new end product. In addition, we
            would introduce a digital database to manage the
            individual contribution of our target population and
            promote a high performance, efficient and flexible
            workforce.

            Our vision is to be a substantial proponent of the
            transition from Nigerianâ€™s low participation in waste
            recycling to the use of efficient waste management
            technology and delivery of zero waste status which is
            in line with the 17 SDG's of the United Nations. H)
            Use of funds: we will be able to divert additional 20
            tonnes of recyclables away from landfill monthly,
            currently we divert over 15-25 tonnes of waste, and
            employ over 17 young people and also provides 120
            indirect jobs through waste collectors ( Youths,
            sit-at-home women, scavengers, waste contractors) who
            sell to Green Axis on a regular.
